# 2022-DART
Learning Dart in 2022

Dart is based on Javascript, but it has lots of add-ons:

Lots of new concept 
Blow my mind : Shocked!
Something I have never seen in my 1 year coding journey

Big mistake1: The Bar is the code base, the tutorial from Grokking the code interview only covers 10% of what I need. Not enough at All. Far from enough. Very misleading.

Big mistake2: There is deprecated material in the tuotiral, this should not happen. Added on 2022 Feb 20th, with dart null safety, lots of the code in the tutorial are not going to work any more!

// The real code base relies heavily on the other 80%
