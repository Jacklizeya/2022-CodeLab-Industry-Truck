This is where the dependency injection framework comes into play. 
Imagine the framework had something called an injector. 
You register some classes with this injector, and it figures out how to create them.

Angular dependency injection
Angular ships with its own dependency injection framework. 
You’ll learn Angular dependency injection through a discussion of the sample app that accompanies this page. 

Register with provider, then injector will create it


ClassProvider(Logger),
ClassProvider(Logger, useClass: BetterLogger),

ClassProvider(NewLogger),
ExistingProvider(OldLogger, NewLogger),

ValueProvider(Logger, silentLogger),

Factory providers: For any service that needs an input, go one level above it

You can inject the Logger, but you can’t inject the boolean isAuthorized. 
You’ll have to take over the creation of new instances of this HeroService with a factory provider.
