Smart way, right way: Dependency Injection
First step is decoupling
Second step is abstract (any monitor will work with me)




Stupid way: 
Create a service every time
Hard coded service every time
Hard to change, hard to switch, switch from Samsung Monitor to LG monitor, recode everyting

This is the first time I get into the design pattern
